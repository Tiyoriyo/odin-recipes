            <li>2 1/2 tbsp shaoxing wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dark soy sauce</li>
            <li>5 cups water</li>
            <li>oil</li>
            <li>1 garlic clove(s)</li>
            <li>1 lemongrass stalk(s)</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp sesame oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp sugar</li>
            <li>1 tbsp chilli sauce (raw)</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Remove excess skin from chicken thighs. Marinate chicken thighs with salt, white pepper, pounded shallots and ginger. Bruise scallions and rub chicken thighs with it. Leave chicken to marinate for at least 1 hour.</em></li>
            <li><em>Heat vinegar at medium heat. Stir in maltose, dark soy sauce and Shaoxing wine. Set aside to cool to room temperature.</em></li>
            <li><em>Bring water to boil. Once the water begins boiling, add chicken thighs. When water starts boiling again, transfer chicken to the vinegar mixture. Ensure that every part of the chicken thigh especially the skin is soaked with the vinegar mixture (ca. 5 minutes). Then, leave aside to dry for at least 3 hours. Meanwhile, set aside the water which was used to boil the chicken. It will be used to cook rice later on.</em></li>
            <li><em>Heat oil at medium heat. Ensure that there is no excess liquid on the chicken thighs before frying. Once the oil is hot (ca. 150 C/300 F), fry the chicken thighs until browned.</em></li>
            <li><em>Render chicken skin for its oil at low heat. Then, remove chicken skin and sauté sliced shallots, minced ginger, minced garlic and lemongrass until fragrant. Add rice and the broth from Step 2. Stir in salt. Bring to boil. Once it begins boiling, reduce heat and simmer until rice is cooked.</em></li>
            <li><em>To prepare soy sauce, mix sugar, Shaoxing wine, sesame oil and 1 tablespoon of chicken broth (from Step 2) together. As for the chilli sauce, mix ‘cili garam’ (raw chilli sauce) with 0.5 tablespoon of chicken broth. Serve chicken with rice and accompanying sauces.</em></li>
